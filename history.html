<h2>Making pizza since 1960...</h2>

<p>Like most corporate success stories, Domino's started out small &ndash; with just one store in 1960. However, in 1978 the
    200th Domino's store opened, and things really began to cook. By 1983 there were 1,000 Domino's stores and 5,000 in
    1989. Today, there are over 17,600 stores &ndash; including more than 11,000 outside the United States. Sure, it took more
    than 50 years to get here, but the trip was well worth it. Feel free to take the journey yourself. Order a hot,
    Domino's Pizza for delivery to your door and make your family's dinner the best they have ever had.</p>
